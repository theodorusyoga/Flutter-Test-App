# TVLK Clone App

A clone of Traveloka landing page (but not everything ðŸ‘€). My first project using Flutter.

## Quick Preview

The GIF says it all~
Basically, the app consists of 2 screens: `Home` and `Search` screen. You can go to `Search` screen by clicking the search box on the header section.
Bonus: the placeholder of the search input box is animated to match the behavior of TVLK app (for research purposes ðŸ™ˆ), using `Tween<Offset>`.

        â”œâ”€â”€ images          # Image files
      â”œâ”€â”€ helpers           # Helpers files (currently used for currency converter)
      â”œâ”€â”€ mocks             # Since API is not provided, we have this folder to store any example data
      â”œâ”€â”€ model             # MVVM Model
      â”œâ”€â”€ redux             # Redux files (Action, State, Reducers) using Redux Thunk

         â”œâ”€â”€ components     # Small widgets from respective screen or components
      â”œâ”€â”€ view_model        # MVVM View Model, since no API is provided, we use view model to retrieve data from mocks
      â”œâ”€â”€ test              # Test files
         â”œâ”€â”€ mocks          # Mock data for test files
         â”œâ”€â”€ ...            # Widget folder to be tested

## Getting Started

To run the project, simply run: `flutter run`

## Unit Test Coverage

What has been accomplished:

- Redux unit test
- View model unit test
- Widget test only on: `MenuItem` and `ExploreItem`

What can be improved:

- Functional test
- Integration test (we need a working API)

To run unit test with code coverage without including assets and styles, please run below command.

```
flutter test --coverage && lcov --remove coverage/lcov.info '**/styles.dart' 'lib/assets/*'  -o coverage/new_lcov.info && genhtml coverage/new_lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

To see your code coverage, go to `coverage/html/index.html`.

## Packages Used

- `carousel_slider`: used for 4x3 menu list. The user can swipe right and left through different list of menu
- `flutter_spinkit`: for loading indicator
- `flutter_redux` and `redux`: used for centralized state management. In the app, redux is only used to determine whether loading indicator is shown
- `intl`: for currency converter
- `redux_thunk`: middleware for redux, making action execution easier
- `scroll_snap_list`: to display horizontal list view for food/services list, which is the extension of `ListView`
- `sticky_headers`: to display the title of food/services list
